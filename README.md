## Python Workshop - Navigating the Many Worlds of Pythonic Development

---

Hey there, and welcome!

In this small set of workshops, we will be working through three small exercises:

1. Setting up a server which is a bit... buggy (aren't they all?);
2. Extracting log lines from this server and placing them into a nicely formatted file;
3. Visualising these log lines in meaningful ways.

At large, in the Software Industry, observability and monitoring are huge components of building high-reliability software systems. Through these two practices, servers which are accesssed millions of times per day (and for some, per hour) can best report how they are doing to the engineers behind them.

As such, the exercise of generating, extracting and visualising logs is a key task for modern software engineers.

Let's see how we go trying to emulate this process - all driven by the dynamic programming magic of Python üêç
