## Step 2: Being a Data Janitor 🧹

Okay... so! We have now generated logs from the application server in Step 1. Now, let's copy these logs over and clean them up a bit.

## Setup

As in Step 1, ensure you have version 3+ of Python installed.

## Task

Our goal is to:

- Extract log lines which are valuable to our analysis - HTTP status codes, timestamps, etc.
- Send these formatted log lines into another file, which will be used in Step 3.

We are now entering the realm of data science and analysis. Let's see how we go 💪🏻
