## Step 3: Dashboards, Graphs and Pandas 🐼

---

Now that we have the data... let's use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to begin analysing the data we have acquired further.

In particular, we want to understand what trends we are observing over time for:

- Number of responses which are successful (200) and not successful (>= 400);
- Number of responses which hit different endpoints.
